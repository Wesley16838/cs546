		<h1 class="about_title2">What's Next?</h1>

		<p class="about_p2">With the necessary resources we would implement a personal recommendation system that touches user data of books both looked at and purchased to give a list of books the user may enjoy.</p>

		<p class ="list_text"> In the future, we would also love to develop a mobile app to give even more accessability to people regardless of where they are.</p>
